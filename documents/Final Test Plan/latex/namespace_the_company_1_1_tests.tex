class \hyperlink{class_the_company_1_1_tests_1_1_add_employee_tests}{Add\+Employee\+Tests}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em {\bfseries  Brief Description} This class is used to test the Add\+Employee methods in the Container class. The methods tested include Get\+Fulltime\+Employee\+Properties, Get\+Parttime\+Employee\+Properties, Get\+Contract\+Employee\+Properties, Get\+Seasonal\+Employee\+Properties and Add\+Employee. Some of the methods in this class require user input for testing (they will have a string called data\+To\+Pass\+In, and will use Console.\+Set\+In() and String\+Reader). To test the methods with user input, Console.\+Set\+In() and String\+Reader are used to simulate the user input. The idea/code to use the Console.\+Set\+In() and String\+Reader for user input was borrowed from Assaf Stone\textquotesingle{}s post at this link\+: \href{http://www.softwareandi.com/2012/02/how-to-write-automated-tests-for.html}{\tt http\+://www.\+softwareandi.\+com/2012/02/how-\/to-\/write-\/automated-\/tests-\/for.\+html} \end{DoxyCompactList}\item
